# This is a Go solution to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge, I've built my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, I've learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
